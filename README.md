E-commerce Company Performance: Customer Growth, Product Quality, and Payment Methods.

Before starting the data processing, the initial step that needs to be taken is preparing raw data to become structured and ready for processing. Data in CSV format is imported into database tables using PostgreSQL. Subsequently, creating Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) among these tables. Once the ERD is obtained, data analysis is carried out.

The customer growth metrics can be determined from customer activities within the eCommerce platform. Some metrics related to customer activity include the number of active customers, the number of new customers, the number of customers making repeat orders, and the average annual transaction per customer.

The performance of an eCommerce business is closely related to the products available within it. Analyzing the quality of products in eCommerce can lead to better business development decisions. Product quality analysis is conducted by assessing the performance of each product category and its correlation with the company's revenue.

E-commerce businesses typically offer open-payment systems that allow customers to choose from a variety of available payment methods. Analyzing the performance of these payment types can provide insights for creating better strategic partnerships with payment service providers. The analysis of payment type performance is conducted by examining the available payment methods and observing trends in changes that have occurred over the past few years.
